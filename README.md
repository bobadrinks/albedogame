# Pocket Penguins
A simple HTML5 game, built using HTML and JavaScript.

## Gameplay
Everyone knows that penguins only live in Antarctica! But not you...you, my penguin friend, are in the Arctic. Well, sure, maybe you're lost, a little bit far from home - but the way I see it, you've got a mission.

Belly-slide your way to victory! Bare ice is safe to slide on, but buy yourself more time by sliding through patches of dark ice to restore them to normal. Avoid any patches of snow-covered ice, since snow-covered ice reflects more light and keeps the water cool.

As the game goes on, there will be less ice to slide on. More pools of water will appear in your path; jump over these or avoid them to keep your penguin bellysliding forward.

### Objective
Keep your penguin alive as long as possible to earn a higher score! Unlock more items and maps as you go.

### Controls
Press the left and right arrowkeys to move your penguin left or right, or the up arrowkey to make your penguin jump over a patch of melted ice. Press the spacebar to pause the game.

## The Science of Albedo: Earth's Reflectivity
Let's visit the Arctic! Brr. Sheets of snow-covered ice, lying on top of dark ocean water...

Those sheets of ice reflect sunlight and keep the rest of the world cool. On the other hand, ocean water absorbs most of the sunlight that hits it, absorbing energy and heat. In the Arctic, when ice melts, the albedo drops -- less light gets reflected, more heat is absorbed by the ocean...And the ocean water heats up, melting more ice...

The ice sheets of the Arctic regulate Earth's temperature by reflecting a lot of sunlight. Dark ice (dirtied by pollutants or soot or algae) melts faster; snow-covered ice melts more slowly.
